       <p>Story of Raja Ram Mohan Roy</p>
       <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Ram_Mohan_Roy">
        Ram Mohan Roy FRAS (22 May 1772 â€“ 27 September 1833) was an Indian reformer who was one of the founders of the Brahmo Sabha in 1828, the precursor of the Brahmo Samaj, a social-religious reform movement in the Indian subcontinent. He was given the title of Raja by Akbar II, the Mughal emperor. His influence was apparent in the fields of politics, public administration, education and religion. He was known for his efforts to abolish the practices of sati and child marriage.[1] Roy is considered to be the "Father of Indian Renaissance"
         by many historians.[2]
